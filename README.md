# simple-sr-xml2json
Convert the xml structure from the SR into json. 

## How to use
Just open the xml2json.html file in your browser, select an XML-File downloaded from the SR (admin.ch) and click "Parse". 
The XML-File will be converted to two different json-strings (one complete, one of the text only). 

## Disclaimer
It is very likely, that this will not work for all laws, and it is certain, that there are bugs, as this was a quick hack for a task I'm trying to solve.
